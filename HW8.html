    <b>1.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Problem 10(a)-(c) page 210. This problem
    is meant to illuminate the workings of Depth-First Search.<br>
    <br>
    <div>
      One of the earliest published descriptions of whatever-first search as a
      generic class of algorithms was by Edsger Dijkstra, Leslie Lamport, Alain
      Martin, Carel Scholten, and Elisabeth Steffens in 1975, as part of the design
      of an automatic garbage collector. Instead of maintaining marked and
      unmarked vertices, their algorithm maintains a color for each vertex, which
      is either white, gray, or black. As usual, in the following algorithm, we
      imagine a fixed underlying graph G.      
    </div>
    <pre>
      ThreeColorSearch(s):
        color all nodes white
        color s gray
        while at least one vertex is gray
          ThreeColorStep( ) 


      ThreeColorStep( ):
        v <- any gray vertex
        if v has no white neighbors
          color v black
        else
          w <- any white neighbor of v
          parent(w) <- v
          color w gray
    </pre>
    <div>
      (a) Prove that ThreeColorSearch maintains the following invariant at
      all times: No black vertex is a neighbor of a white vertex. [Hint: This
      should be easy.]
    </div>
    <pre>
      Vertexes are only colored white at the start of the problem.
      Vertexes are only colored black if they have no white neighbors

      This means a brand new black vertex has no white neighbors
      And since we never color a vertex white after initialization there is never an opportunity for a white to become that black vertexes neighbor
    </pre>
    <div>
      (b) Prove that after ThreeColorSearch(s) terminates, all vertices reachable from s are black, all vertices not reachable from s are white, and
      that the parent edges vparent(v) define a rooted spanning tree of the
      component containing s.
      [Hint: Intuitively, black nodes are “marked” and gray nodes are “in
      the bag”. Unlike our formulation of WhateverFirstSearch, however,
      the three-color algorithm is not required to process all edges out of a
      node at the same time.]
    </div>
    <pre>
      The algorithm will get a white neighbor of a gray vertiex and make it gray
      So the algorithm will reach all vertixes reachable by the initial vertex since neighbors
      Since it grabs any gray vertex we can assume theres a scenario where if theres a vertex with a white neighor, we select that vertex and make the neighbor gray
      This will make all reachable vertexes of s gray, then if we keep running the algorithm, all those gray vertexes have no white neighbors so they all become black eventually

      All vertexes not reachable never become gray and thus never become black, they stay white

      This makes a spanning tree since each node will only have one parent
      This is because the same time a vetex gets a parent when turning from white to gray which can only happen once
    </pre>
    <div>
      (c) Prove that the following variant of ThreeColorSearch, which maintains the set of gray vertices in a standard stack, is equivalent to
        depth-first search. [Hint: The order of the last two lines of ThreeColorStackStep matters!]
    </div>
    <pre>
      ThreeColorSearch(s):
        color all nodes white
        color s gray
        <b>push s onto the stack</b>
        while at least one vertex is gray
          ThreeColorStep( ) 


      ThreeColorStep( ):
        <b>pop v from the stack</b>
        v <- any gray vertex
        if v has no white neighbors
          color v black
        else
          w <- any white neighbor of v
          parent(w) <- v
          color w gray
          <b>push v onto the stack</b>
          <b>push w onto the stack</b>


      Since the push actions first push the parent then the child this is DFS
      The "pop v from stack" action will always pop the vertex that just became gray, which is the most recent child vertex.

      It will keep pushing and popping the child until the child has no white neighbors
      Then after that reaches the end of the tree it will recurse back up and start popping the parents of the child and getting other children of that parent
      
      We can see it will go as deep down the tree as it can before coming back up to try other nodes of the tree

      the graph modeling the problem and computing the <tt>_.pre</tt>
      and <tt>_.post</tt> values at every vertex can be used to solve
      this problem. <br>
    </p><br>
    <pre>
      In my solution I kept track of whether the connection flight was on the stack or not.

      If the traversal of the graph brought us back to an already visited destination, that doesnt't always mean there's a loop.  There could be two disjointed paths going to the same destination.

      We need to check whether the destination has been visted before AND if that destination is currently on the stack. 
      If its still on the stack, that means we havent recursed back to that destination. We are still traversing with that destination as an ancestor which means there is a path from destination to the current station

      <br>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>(a)</b>&nbsp; Explain how a DFS traversal
      of the graph modeling the problem and computing the DFS traversal
      tree rooted at the starting tree can be used to solve this
      problem.
    </p>
    <br>
    <pre>
      Traverising the graph in this problem works because we can recurse through all potential routes to the destination.  We don't need to revisit stations since those will be computed eventually if when we recurse back.
      Traversing lets us compute whether the destination is reachable and then all we need is some extra logic to store the path taken and we get the solution.
