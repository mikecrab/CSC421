    <br>
    <div>
      This exercise asks you to develop efficient algorithms to find optimal subsequences of various kinds. A subsequence is anything obtained from a sequence
      by extracting a subset of elements, but keeping them in the same order; the
      elements of the subsequence need not be contiguous in the original sequence.
      For example, the strings C, DAMN, YAIOAI, and DYNAMICPROGRAMMING are all
      subsequences of the string DYNAMICPROGRAMMING.
      [Hint: Exactly one of these problems can be solved in O(n) time using a
      greedy algorithm.]

    <div>
      (a) Let A[1 .. m] and B[1 .. n] be two arbitrary arrays. A common subsequence of A and B is another sequence that is a subsequence of both
        A and B. Describe an efficient algorithm to compute the length of the
        longest common subsequence of A and B.
    </div>
    <br>
    <pre>
      We came up with a recursive solution to this problem in an earlier homework

      lcs(A[i .. n], B[j .. m]):
        if length A == 0 OR length B == 0
          return 0
        if A[1] == B[1] {
          return lcs(A[i + 1 .. n], B[j + 1 .. n]) + 1
        } else {
            return max(lcs(A[i + 1 .. n], B[j .. n]), lcs(A[i .. n], B[j + 1 .. n]))
        }

        The subproblems are lcs(i to n+1, j to n+1) where when i = n + 1 or j = m + 1 then the lcs is 0, else the lcs(i, j) is the max of lcs(i + 1, j), lcs(i, j + 1)

        We can store the memozation solutions in a 2d array [i to n+1, j to m+1]

        Since lcs(i, j) = max lcs(i + 1, j), lcs(i, j + 1), we must calculate lcs from n+1->1 so we have those dependencies calulated already

        fastLcs(A[1 ... n], B[1 ... m]) {
          lcsTable
          for x = 1 in range(n + 1)
            lcsTable[x, n + 1] = 0
          for x = 1 in range(m + 1)
            lcsTable[m+1, x] = 0

          for i = length(A) + 1 to 1 {
            for j = length(B) + 1 to 1 {
              if A[i] == B[i] {
                lcsTable[i, j] = lcsTable[i + 1, j + 1]
              } else {
                lcsTable[i, j] = max(lcsTable[i + 1, j], lcsTable[i, j + 1])
              }
            }
          }

          return lcsTable[1, 1]
        }

    <div>
      A palindrome is any string that is exactly the same as its reversal, like I, or
      DEED, or RACECAR, or AMANAPLANACATACANALPANAMA.

    <br>
    <div>
      Describe and analyze an algorithm to find the length of the longest
      subsequence of a given string that is also a palindrome.
      For example, the longest palindrome subsequence of the string
      MAHDYNAMICPROGRAMZLETMESHOWYOUTHEM is MHYMRORMYHM; thus, given
      that string as input, your algorithm should return 11.
    </div>
    <br>
    <pre>
      i, j start at the ends of a string S then recursively increment/decrement their way until the base case of them equalling each other
      palindrome(i, j) {
        // in case the return palindrome(i + 1, j - 1) call causes i to be greater than j
        if i > j 
          // this means theres 2 characters and they are equal so return 2
          if S[i] == S[j]
            return 2
          else
            reuturn 0
        // one character is a palindrome of length 1
        if i == j
          return 1

        // if characters are equal, increment sum by 2 for the 2 matching character then move i and j closer together by 1 each
        if S[i] == S[j]
          return palindrome(i + 1, j - 1) + 1
        else
          // if there not equal try both the next characters for i and j to see if they are equal
          return max(palindrome(i + 1, j), palindrome(i, j - 1))        
      }

      i > j && S[i] == S[j]             0
      i > j && S[i] != S[j]             2
      i == j                            1
      S[i] == S[j]                      palindrome(i + 1, j - 1) + 1
      else                              max(palindrome(i + 1, j), palindrome(i, j - 1))

      Again we can memoize this with a 2d array of [1 to n, 1 to n]
    </pre>
    <img width="50%" src="palindrome.png">
    <pre>
      Based on this table we need to calculate 5 to 1 for i and 1 to 5 for j

      palindrome(S) {
        n = length(S)
        p = []
        for i to n
          p[i, i] = 1

        for i = n to 1
          for j = i+1 to n
            if i + 1 == j && S[i] == S[j]
              p[i, j] = 2
            else if S[i] == S[j]
              p[i, j] = 2 + p[i + 1, j - 1]
            else
              p[i, j] = max(p[i + 1, j], p[i, j - 1])

    <b>3.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the suggestion in the footnote on
    page 162 of you textbook and develop a recursive backtracking
    algorithm and then a dynamic programming algorithm for the activity
    selection problem. Do this by going through the steps 1(a), 1(b),
    2(a), ...&nbsp; listed at the beginning of the lecture 6 slides.
    Steps 1(a) and 1(b) and the insight shown in slides 85-89 will lead
    you to the recursive backtracking algorithm. Steps 2(a) through 2(d)
    will lead you to the dynamic programming algorithm. Make sure to
    analyze the running time of your dynamic programming algorithm.<br>

    <div>
      The GreedySchedule algorithm we described for the class scheduling
      problem is not the only greedy strategy we could have tried. For each of
      the following alternative greedy strategies, either prove that the resulting
      algorithm always constructs an optimal schedule, or describe a small input
      176
      Exercises
      example for which the algorithm does not produce an optimal schedule.
      Assume that all algorithms break ties arbitrarily (that is, in a manner that
      is completely out of your control). [Hint: Three of these algorithms are
      actually correct.]

      1a.   Input of index i for an array X[i ... n] and the current sum.  Recursively include and exclude each option in the array and return the one that returns the closest sum to the target 1000
      1b.   start at input walrus(1, 0) each recuresive call will follow this formula
            walrus(i, sum)
              if sum = 1000             return 1000
              if i = length(X)          return sum
              else                      include = walrus(i + 1, sum + X[i])
                                        exclude = walrus(i + 1, sum)
                                        if absoluteValue(1000 - include) <= absoluteValue(1000 - exclude)
                                          return include
                                        else
                                          return exclude
      
      2a.   The subproblems are walrus(i, sum) where 0 <= i <= length(X) and 0 <= sum.  Sum doesn't really have a set endpoint
      2b.   So we need a 2d array [i, j] where i is 1 -> length(X) and j is 0 -> total sum of all values in X
      2c.   Each entry in the memoized array needs either the answer done for either [i + 1, sum + X[i]] or [i + 1, sum]
      <img width="30%" src="walrus.png">
      2d.   This means we must solve the problem i = length(x) to 1 and j = sum all X to 0
