    <b>1.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Problem 14(a) page 51 in your textbook.<br>
    <div> Suppose you are given two sets of n points, one set {p1
      , p2
      , . . . , pn
      } on the
      line y = 0 and the other set {q1
      , q2
      , . . . , qn
      } on the line y = 1. Create a set
      of n line segments by connect each point p<sub>i</sub>
      to the corresponding point q<sub>i</sub>
      .
      Describe and analyze a divide-and-conquer algorithm to determine how
      many pairs of these line segments intersect, in O(n log n) time. [Hint:
      See the previous problem.
    </div>
    <br>
    <pre>
      Two lines will intercect in two scenarios
      Either p[i] > p[j] AND q[i] < q[j]
      OR
      p[i] < p[j] AND q[i] > q[j]

      We can solve this by with two merge sorts with some extra functionality

      We do the classic mergesort on set p.
      Recurseively dividing p in half and using the left and right halfs as input in recusrion
      Base case is when there is only one element left in the array
      Merge the left and right together by going through left and right and adding them to new array sorted
      Any sorting done When the left index > right index we need to make sure the same index changes on set Q

      This Recurseively runs until p is completely sorted and q also has the same changes

      We can then run the merge sort again on q with one difference
      Whenever left > right we add one to a counter
      Since p is sorted, any sorting that happens in q means theres an intercect based on the scenarios we layed out earlier

      We return that count at the end of the sort and thats the number of intersections

    <b>2.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Problems 24(a)(b)(c) page 57 in your
    textbook.<br>
    <div>
      Consider the following classical recursive algorithm for computing the
      factorial n! of a non-negative integer n:
      <pre>
        Factorial(n):
          if n = 0
            return 1
          else
            return n * Factorial(n - 1)
      </pre>    
    <div>(a) How many multiplications does this algorithm perform?</div>
    <br>
    <div>n multiplications are performed</div>
    <br>
    <div>(b) How many bits are required to write n! in binary? Express your answer
      in the form &Theta;(f (n)), for some familiar function f (n). [Hint: (n/2)<sup>n/2</sup> < n! < n<sup>n</sup>.]
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div>
        (c) Your answer to (b) should convince you that the number of multiplications
        is not a good estimate of the actual running time of Factorial. We
        can multiply any k-digit number and any l-digit number in O(k * l) time
        using either the lattice algorithm or duplation and mediation. What is
        the running time of Factorial if we use this multiplication algorithm as
        a subroutine?

    <b>3.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Problem 2(a) page 94 in your textbook.
    Do this by appropriately modifying the pseudo-code on page 84 of the
    textbook.<br>
    <div>
      Describe recursive algorithms for the following variants of the text segmentation problem. Assume that you have a subroutine IsWord that takes an
      array of characters as input and returns True if and only if that string is a
      "word".      
    </div>
    <div>
      (a) Given an array A[1 .. n] of characters, compute the number of partitions
      of A into words. For example, given the string ARTISTOIL, your algorithm
      should return 2, for the partitions ARTIST-OIL and ART-IS-TOIL.
    </div>
    <pre>
      {{Is the suffix A[i .. n] Splittable?}}
        // set global var sum to keep track of all valid answers
        sum = 0

        Splittable(i):
          if i > n
            return true
          for j = i to n
            if IsWord(i, j)
              if Splittable(j + 1)
                sum = sum + 1
          return False

    <b>4.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Problem 4(a) page 94 in your textbook.
    You may answer this question with a recursive formula or an
    algorithm described using pseudo-code. Hint: compare <tt>A[1]</tt>
    and <tt>B[1]</tt>, consider the two cases <tt>A[1]==B[1]</tt> and
    <tt>A[1] != B[1]</tt>, and write/compute the <tt>LCS(A[1..n],
      B[1..n])</tt> in terms of <tt>LCS(A[2..n],B[2..n])</tt>,&nbsp; <tt>LCS(A[1..n],B[2..n])</tt>,
    and <tt>LCS(A[2..n], B[1..n])</tt>.<br><br>
    <div>
      (a) Let A[1 .. m] and B[1 .. n] be two arbitrary arrays. A common subsequence
        of A and B is both a subsequence of A and a subsequence of B. Give
        a simple recursive definition for the function lcs(A, B), which gives the
        length of the longest common subsequence of A and B.
    </div>
    <br>
    <pre>
      Basically recursively check if the first index of each matches
      If they do move on to the next character for both
      If not remove the first index of the longer one and recurse until one array is empty

      lcs(A[i .. n], B[j .. n]):
        if length A == 0 OR length B == 0
          return 0
        if A[1] == B[1] {
          return lcs(A[i + 1 .. n], B[j + 1 .. n]) + 1
        } else {
          if length A > length B {
            return lcs(A[i + 1 .. n], B[j .. n])
          } else {
            return lcs(A[i .. n], B[j + 1 .. n])

      <div>
        This problem asks you to design backtracking algorithms to find the cost of
        an optimal binary search tree that satisfies additional balance constraints.
        Your input consists of a sorted array A[1 .. n] of search keys and an array
        f [1 .. n] of frequency counts, where f [i] is the number of searches for A[i].
        This is exactly the same cost function as described in Section 2.8. But
        now your task is to compute an optimal tree that satisfies some additional
        constraints.
      </div>
      <br>
      <div>
        (a) AVL trees were the earliest self-balancing balanced binary search trees,
        first described in 1962 by Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Evgenii Landis. An
        AVL tree is a binary search tree where for every node v, the height of
        the left subtree of v and the height of the right subtree of v differ by at
        most one.

        Describe a recursive backtracking algorithm to construct an optimal
        AVL tree for a given set of search keys and frequencies.
      </div>
      <br>
      <pre>
        We can use the formula from lecture that calculates total cost recursively for each specific node chosen to be the root
        Cost(T, f [1..n]) =SUM(i=1 -> n for f[i]) + Cost(LEFT SUBTREE(T), f [1..r - 1]) + Cost(RIGHT SUBTREE(T), f [r + 1])

        To do a normal cost optimization of a tree we
        We pass in as input the tree, height of current node, and A
        For each A[i] we insert A[i] into the tree 
        We recursively cut A in half and run and sum the cost functions on the left and right half of the array so the new A[] will be either the left or right half in the next recursive call
        We save this sum in a minValue var and change whats saved if any other node being the root creates a more optimal cost
        After the sums return we can also check here whether the tree is AVL, if the height of the left subtree - height of right subtree is > 1 or < -1 then the tree is imbalanced and we can prune this result
        We keep cutting the array in half until the base case on one element in the array in which case the forumla above would equal Cost(T, f [1..n]) =SUM(i=1 -> n for f[i]) + <s>Cost(LEFT SUBTREE(T), f [1..r - 1]) + Cost(RIGHT SUBTREE(T), f [r + 1])</s>, so return f[i]
